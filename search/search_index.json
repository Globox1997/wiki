In my free time I like to create fabric Minecraft mods, specifically in the rpg and medieval genre. I love the game plus its possibilities, have fun with it and have a good one!</p>"},{"location":"#sources","title":"Sources","text":"<p>The entirety of this site is available on GitHub, where you can submit additions and corrections or report issues you found.</p>"},{"location":"#story","title":"Story","text":"<p>Some people asked me, how did I get to Minecraft modding and I will answer this question here.  </p> <p>Back in 2018 (when I remember correctly) I made my first simple mod using a mod creator tool. Personally I never used it and even tho I published it, I left it. Later in 2019 my friends and I came up with the idea to play Minecraft again, since quite a lot of updates rolled out since we last played it.  </p> <p>When I was younger (around 2012) I played vanilla Minecraft a lot for quite some time which lead to a boredom feeling about it. Playing it off and on, 1.7.10 was a big update for Minecraft and around that time I started playing modded to enhance the world of possibilities. Back to 2019, I was looking for mods to play Minecraft on the latest version but the Forge modloader was not updated for whatever reason. During my search I stumbled about this new modloader called Fabric, which I never heard about before since Forge was the main one and all big modpacks were based on it. But since I was looking for mods to play with on the latest mc version, the Fabric modloader was the only one which offered my request.  </p> <p>So I started to put some newly fabric mods together and made a pack to play Minecraft with my friends again. We never played that pack, lul xD. During the creation of the pack, I realized, man, there are not many mods at all for the fabric modloader and the main missing thing was, there were no real adventure mods like mods which add new mobs to the world. So one of the biggest requirements we had was just missing. So I came up with idea, why not creating something by myself?  </p> <p>I looked into youtube, found out about the fabric wiki which both had some information about how to create a fabric mod already. So I just started to create a simple one, which I called AppleZ. A simple mod which adds new apples and when eaten, the player will get bonus effects. The world of modding consumed me and I started to create a project here and there, made my main goal called MobZ back then, which offered new adventures by adding mobs and bosses to the world of Minecraft.  </p> <p>Since then funnily enough I never played Minecraft again (except for some tests of course) and that is the story of how I got into Minecraft modding.</p> <p>More Story</p>"},{"location":"about/credits/","title":"Credits","text":"<p>Globox_Z mods includes and/or makes use of the following software under their respective licenses: </p>"},{"location":"about/credits/#minecraft","title":"Minecraft","text":"<ul> <li>http://minecraft.net</li> <li>Content and materials are trademarks and copyrights of Mojang AB.
