I love the game plus its possibilities, have fun with it and have a good one!</p>"},{"location":"#sources","title":"Sources","text":"<p>The entirety of this site is available on GitHub, where you can submit additions and corrections or report issues you found.</p>"},{"location":"#story","title":"Story","text":"<p>Some people asked me, how did I get to Minecraft modding and I will answer this question here.  </p> <p>Back in 2018 (when I remember correctly) I made my first simple mod using a mod creator tool. Personally I never used it and even tho I published it, I left it. Later in 2019 my friends and I came up with the idea to play Minecraft again, since quite a lot of updates rolled out since we last played it.  </p> <p>When I was younger (around 2012) I played vanilla Minecraft a lot for quite some time which lead to a boredom feeling about it. Playing it off and on, 1.7.10 was a big update for Minecraft and around that time I started playing modded to enhance the world of possibilities. Back to 2019, I was looking for mods to play Minecraft on the latest version but the Forge modloader was not updated for whatever reason. During my search I stumbled about this new modloader called Fabric, which I never heard about before since Forge was the main one and all big modpacks were based on it. But since I was looking for mods to play with on the latest mc version, the Fabric modloader was the only one which offered my request.  </p> <p>So I started to put some newly fabric mods together and made a pack to play Minecraft with my friends again. We never played that pack, lul xD. During the creation of the pack, I realized, man, there are not many mods at all for the fabric modloader and the main missing thing was, there were no real adventure mods like mods which add new mobs to the world. So one of the biggest requirements we had was just missing. So I came up with idea, why not creating something by myself?  </p> <p>I looked into youtube, found out about the fabric wiki which both had some information about how to create a fabric mod already. So I just started to create a simple one, which I called AppleZ. A simple mod which adds new apples and when eaten, the player will get bonus effects. The world of modding consumed me and I started to create a project here and there, made my main goal called MobZ back then, which offered new adventures by adding mobs and bosses to the world of Minecraft.  </p> <p>Since then funnily enough I never played Minecraft again (except for some tests of course) and that is the story of how I got into Minecraft modding.</p> <p>More Story</p>"},{"location":"datapack/","title":"Datapack","text":"<p>The knowledge for how to create a datapack in Minecraft is important if you want to use a datapack system of any kind of mods.

Most mobs spawn naturally, depending on the light level, biome, and their surroundings. For example, most animals are found in bright areas on the surface, while hostile monsters are commonly found in the dark (whether it's a cave, dungeon, mansion, or at night). Animals usually spawn upon chunk generation, while hostile monsters spawn and despawn in certain radii around the player. Some mobs including passive and neutral animals have the ability to be bred by the player, creating offspring. Villagers also breed randomly depending on the time of day and the number of beds. Most mobs never spawn on transparent blocks, in water, in lava, on bedrock, or on blocks less than a full block tall.

When mobs are killed, they turn to dust and drop items that may be useful resources. Each type of mob in Minecraft has a certain AI (artificial intelligence) system with different behaviors and mechanics. Mobs ordinarily wander around at random if there is a player within 32 blocks and usually avoid walking off blocks high enough to cause falling damage. Many mobs have an advanced path-finding system that allows them to navigate through obstacles to get to a desired object or destination. Passive mobs flee in random directions after being hurt, while hostile mobs face and chase/attack the player as soon as the player comes close. Neutral mobs remain neutral until a player or mob provokes it (usually by attacking), at which point neutral mob becomes hostile toward and attacks the entity that hit it. Most mobs are aware of players within 16 blocks of them, but some can see farther.</p> <p>Most mobs cannot see through most solid blocks, including semi-transparent blocks such as ice, glass, tall grass, or glass panes.<sup>2</sup></p>"},{"location":"mods/AdventureZ/Entities/#list-of-entities","title":"List of entities","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Source: Minecraft Wiki.\u00a0\u21a9\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Source: Minecraft Wiki.\u00a0\u21a9\u21a9\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"mods/AdventureZ/Entities/Amethyst_Golem/","title":"Amethyst Golem","text":"ID <pre><code>adventurez:amethyst_golem\n</code></pre> Health Points Armor Points Attack Strength Projectile Damage Spawn Amethyst Geode Drops 0 - 2 Amethyst Shard Behavior Hostile"},{"location":"mods/AdventureZ/Entities/Amethyst_Golem/#story","title":"Story","text":"<p>The Amethyst Golem harbors disdain for the human race due to their predominant focus on personal gain, disregarding the deeper significance of their actions.

One material can repair 25% of the target's maximum durability.

In the case of tools and weapons, however, this may be a significantly less economical option; combining two diamond shovels would cost two diamonds in total, while up to four diamonds could be required to directly repair one. Still, it may be worth making the more expensive upgrade if the enchantments are considered difficult to obtain. If the items are unable to be combined, a red \"X\" appears over the arrow pointing to the slot of the resulting item.
