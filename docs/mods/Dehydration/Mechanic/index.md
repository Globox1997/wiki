# Hydration

## Description
Hydration is a similar mechanic like [hunger](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Hunger). Instead of requiring to eat [food](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Food) to not starve to death, the [player](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Player) requires now hydration too.

If the [players](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Player)  hydration level is below <span class="icon-element" icon-count="6" icon-id="thirst"></span>, the [player](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Player) won't be able to [sprint](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Sprinting) anymore.

During [sleep](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Bed#Sleeping) the [player](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Player) will loose <span class="icon-element" icon-count="4" icon-id="thirst"></span> hydration.

If the [players](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Player) hydration is empty the [player](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Player) will start to get [damage](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Damage) every 4 seconds.

Water is classified in three different polution levels:

- Dirty: 75% chance of inflicting water poisoning ([thirst](/wiki/mods/Dehydration/Effects/Thirst) II for 25 seconds)
  
- Impurified: 37.5% chance of inflicting water poisoning ([thirst](/wiki/mods/Dehydration/Effects/Thirst) for 25 seconds)
  
- Purified: 0% chance of inflicting water poisoning
  
Water is by default dirty and can be purified in different ways.

The [player](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Player) can drink water from a [water](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Water) source block while sneaking.

[Purified water](/wiki/mods/Dehydration/Blocks/Purified_Water) can be produced by using a [campfire cauldron](/wiki/mods/Dehydration/Blocks/Campfire_Cauldron) or pumping [purified water](/wiki/mods/Dehydration/Blocks/Purified_Water) with a [bamboo pump](/wiki/mods/Dehydration/Blocks/Bamboo_Pump) or by collecting rain in a [copper cauldron](/wiki/mods/Dehydration/Blocks/Copper_Cauldron) or by collecting [water](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Water) through a [dripstone](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pointed_Dripstone) in a [copper cauldron](/wiki/mods/Dehydration/Blocks/Copper_Cauldron)


## Visuals
Hydration is visualized by droplets on the [players](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Player) [hud](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Heads-up_display) above the [hunger](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Hunger) bar to indicate how much water is left in the [players](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Player) body.
