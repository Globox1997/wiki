# Effect
*An [effect](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Effect) (also known as a mob effect or status effect) is a helpful, harmful or a mostly useless condition that affects an [entity](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Entity). [Effects](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Effect) can be inflicted in various ways throughout the game, including consuming [potions](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Potion) and some [food](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Food) items, being in the range of active [beacons](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Food) and [conduits](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Conduit), and being attacked by or close to certain [mobs](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Mob).*[^1]


## Behavior

*[Entities](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Entity) inflicted by an effect are affected in various ways for an amount of time. For most [effects](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Effect), higher levels increase the strength of the effect. As long as the effect is active, spiral-shaped [particles](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Particles) emanate from the position of the inflicted entity. Effects provided by [beacons](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Beacon) and [conduits](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Conduit) emit semitransparent [particles](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Particles).*

*Any number of different [effects](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Effect), including opposing [effects](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Effect) such as Strength and Weakness, can be simultaneously active on an entity. However, it is not possible to apply the same effect multiple times, even if they are of different levels. When applying an effect already active on the [player](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Player), higher levels overwrite lower levels, and higher durations overwrite lower durations of the same level.*

*A [player](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Player) can remove all of their [effects](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Effect) by either drinking a [milk bucket](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Milk_Bucket), [dying](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Health#Death), or being saved from death by a [totem of undying](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Totem_of_Undying). [Poison](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Poison) can also be removed by drinking a [honey bottle](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Honey_Bottle).*

*Any [damage](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Damage) dealt by [effects](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Effect) is classified as [magic damage](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Damage#Magic_damage) and completely bypasses [armor](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Armor), making it effective at harming highly-armored targets. However, the [Protection](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Protection) enchantment does reduce the damage taken from [effects](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Effect).*[^1]
