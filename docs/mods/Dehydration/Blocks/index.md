# Block

*[Blocks](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Block) are the basic units of structure in [Minecraft](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecraft) that make up the game's world. Many blocks can be collected and placed anywhere in the game's world, as well as be used as helpful resources.*[^1]

## Behavior

*[Blocks](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Block) are arranged in a [3-dimensional grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_honeycomb) of 1-cubic-meter cells, although some blocks appear to occupy a partial cell; these include [slabs](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Slab), [snow](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Snow) layers, [ladders](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Ladder), [vines](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Vines), [stairs](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Stairs), [turtle eggs](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Turtle_Egg), [sea pickles](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Sea_Pickle), and others.*

*Together, [blocks](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Block) and [fluids](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Fluid) build up the in-game environment, and most can be harvested and utilized in various fashions. Some blocks, such as [dirt](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Dirt) and [sandstone](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Sandstone), are [opaque](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Opacity) and occupy their entire cubic meter, while other blocks, such as [glass](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Glass) and [flowers](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Flower), are [transparent](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Opacity#Types_of_transparent_blocks) or non-solid. [Explosions](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Explosion) destroy some blocks more easily than they destroy others. Some blocks are completely immune to [explosions](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Explosion).*

*[Air](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Air) is a special block. It is an unbreakable transparent block, as a substitute for the absence of blocks. It has two variants: [cave air](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Air) and [void airâ€Œ](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Air).*

*Some blocks, such as [sea lantern](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Sea_Lantern) and [glowstone](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Glowstone), emit [light](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Light). The amount of [light](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Light) they emit varies widely; see this [table of light](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Light#Blocks) values for further information. Opaque blocks completely block [light](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Light), while transparent blocks can have no effect on [light](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Light), block the [light](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Light), or merely weaken it.*

*Almost all blocks ignore gravity, except for [sand](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Sand), [red sand](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Sand), [gravel](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Gravel), [anvils](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Anvil) of all damage levels, [dragon eggs](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Dragon_Egg), all colors of [concrete powder](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Concrete_Powder), [scaffolding](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Scaffolding), [pointed dripstone](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pointed_Dripstone), and [suspicious sand and gravel](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Suspicious_Block), all of which turn into [entities](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Falling_Block) when their support is removed.*[^1]
