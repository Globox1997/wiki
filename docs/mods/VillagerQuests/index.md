# Description
VillagerQuests adds (since v.1.1.0) the option to add quests by [FTBQuests](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ftb-quests-fabric) to [villagers](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Villager). The player can only start and complete these quests when accepted and completed at the specific [villager](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Villager).

## Content
How it works:
To set a quest as a villager quest, click on the left top villager head and set a merchant uuid there.
While looking at a merchant, right click the villager head to set the merchants uuid.

If the player now talks to the villager, a new quest screen will show up.

It also adds a new task type called Villager Talk, where the task is, as the name suggests, talking to a specific villager.

For creators there is also an op screen (only accessible when in creative mode by shift+right click)
