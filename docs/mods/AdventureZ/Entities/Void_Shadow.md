## Story

## Behavior

The Void Shadow is the final end boss in Minecraft seen in a different void than the one you probably know.
The Void Shadow will summon Void Shades all over the void to attack all intruders, throw blocks onto them which give hunger, blindness and slowness effects, will partly destroy the platform to decrease the space where the intruder can move to and can only get damaged by destroying Void Fragments which are summoned during the fight.  
There are two types of Void Fragments, only one of them damage the Shadow but all of them have to get destroyed.  
It always hovers around the void platform but if it has less than half of its health points (indicated by getting black) it gets in a death mode where it runs to the middle of the platform where it can get damaged by melee attacks.  
It is invulnerable to arrows and effects.  

* **Magic:** The fighting platform will get magicly destroyed.
* **Range:** From a medium range, the Void Shadow launches blocks at the player, dealing a significant 16 points of damage. These projectiles can also inflict side effects like hunger, slowness, and blindness.
* **Summons:** The Void Shadow has the ability to summon smaller versions of itself to defend its dimension from intruders. These summoned shades will attack all intruders. The Shadow will spawn Void Fragments which have to get destroyed to damage the boss.
    * [Void Shade](/wiki/mods/AdventureZ/Entities/Void_Shade)
    * [Void Fragment](/wiki/mods/AdventureZ/Entities/Void_Fragment)
* **Special:** When the Void Shadow's health drops below half, it enters a state of furious rage, enhancing its abilities and unleashing even more devastating attacks.
