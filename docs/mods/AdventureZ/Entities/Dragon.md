## Story

*The Dragon is the child of the Ender Dragon.*  
*He is peaceful but doesn't like <a href="../Orc/">orcs</a> very much.*

*Often they differ from other Dragons by other eye colors, ears and tail scales.*

## Hatch the Dragon

1. Certain conditions have to match in order to hatch the Dragon

    * Player needs to have the fame effect
    * Dragon Egg needs to be nearby the player

2. The Dragon will start to hatch slowly

    * Indicated by green particles which occur from time to time
    * The hatching process can take up to one Minecraft day (up to 10 minutes)

3. He hatches as a child and needs to grow in order to ride him

    * The growing process can speed up by feeding the Dragon <a href="../../Items/Orc_Skin/">orc skin</a>  
    (he will only eat when he's hungry)
    * The first age to grow takes about 5 minutes without any feeding
