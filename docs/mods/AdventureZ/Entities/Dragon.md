## Story

*The Dragon is the child of the Ender Dragon.*  
*He is peaceful but doesn't like orcs very much.*

*Often they differ from other Dragons by other eye colors, ears and tail scales.*

---

## Hatch the Dragon

1. Certain conditions have to match in order to hatch the Dragon

    * Player needs to have the fame effect
    * Dragon Egg needs to be nearby the player

2. The Dragon will start to hatch slowly

    * Indicated by green particles which occur from time to time
    * The hatching process can take up to one Minecraft day (up to 10 minutes)

3. He hatches as a child and needs to grow in order to ride him

    * The growing process can speed up by feeding the Dragon orc skin  
    (he will only eat when he's hungry)
    * The first age to grow takes about 5 minutes without any feeding

4. Age 1 - Ride the Dragon

    * Equip the Dragon with a Dragon Saddle
    * `"space"` take off and fly up
    * `"left alt"` fly down and land

5. Age 2 - Equip a chest

    * `"e"` open the Dragon's inventory

6. Age 3 - Fully grown

    * heal the Dragon with orc skin and other types of raw meat
    * `"^"` use breath fire
