## Story

*The Dragon is born from the lineage of the mighty Ender Dragon. While generally peaceful in nature, it harbors a strong dislike for <a href="../Orc/">orcs</a>. These Dragons often possess unique characteristics, such as distinct eye colors, ears, and tail scales, setting them apart from their counterparts.*

*Often they differ from other Dragons by other eye colors, ears and tail scales.*

## Hatch the Dragon

1. In order to hatch the Dragon, specific conditions must align:

    * The player must possess the "Fame" effect.
    * The Dragon Egg needs to be in close proximity to the player.
    * These requirements must be met to successfully bring the Dragon into existence. 

2. The Dragon begins its hatching process gradually.

    * This is signified by intermittent green particles. 
    * The process can span up to one Minecraft day, equivalent to approximately 10 minutes in real time.

3. The Dragon begins its journey as a hatchling and requires time to grow before it can be ridden.

    * The growth process can be accelerated by feeding the Dragon <a href="../../Items/Orc_Skin/">orc skin</a>, but it will only consume the food when it is hungry.
    * During the initial growth stage, the Dragon requires approximately 5 minutes to advance without any feeding assistance.
