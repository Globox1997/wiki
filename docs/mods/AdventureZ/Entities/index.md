# Entity

*[Entities](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Entity) encompass all dynamic, moving objects throughout the Minecraft world.*[^1]

*A [mob](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Mob) is an AI-driven game [entity](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Entity) resembling a living creature. The term "mob" is short for "mobile entity".[1] All mobs can be attacked and hurt (from [falling](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Damage#Fall_damage), attacked by a [player](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Player) or another [mob](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Mob), falling into the [void](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Void), hit by an [arrow](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Arrow), etc), and have some form of voluntary movement. Different types of mobs often have unique AI and [loot](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Drops).*[^2]

## Spawning

*[Mobs](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Mob) spawn in various ways. Most mobs spawn naturally, depending on the [light level](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Light#Light-emitting_blocks), [biome](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Biome), and their surroundings. For example, most animals are found in bright areas on the surface, while hostile monsters are commonly found in the dark (whether it's a [cave](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Cave), [dungeon](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Monster_Room), [mansion](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Woodland_Mansion), or at night). Animals usually spawn upon [chunk](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Chunk) generation, while hostile monsters spawn and despawn in certain radii around the player. Some mobs including passive and neutral animals have the ability to be bred by the [player](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Player), creating offspring. [Villagers](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Villager) also breed randomly depending on the time of day and the number of [beds](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Bed). Most [mobs](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Mob) never spawn on [transparent](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Opacity) blocks, in [water](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Water), in [lava](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Lava), on [bedrock](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Bedrock), or on blocks [less than a full block tall](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Solid_block#Height). The exception is [monster spawners](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Monster_Spawner), from which monsters can spawn naturally on any block including [air](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Air).*

*Some [mobs](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Mob) require that the player "construct" them before being able to spawn.*[^2]

## Behavior

*[Mobs](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Mob) are affected by the environment in the same ways as the player; they are subject to [physics](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Physics), and they can be [hurt](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Damage) by the same things that harm the player. When mobs are killed, they turn to [dust](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Particles) and [drop](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Drops) items that may be useful resources. Each type of mob in Minecraft has a certain AI (artificial intelligence) system with different behaviors and mechanics. Mobs ordinarily wander around at random if there is a player within 32 blocks and usually avoid walking off blocks high enough to cause falling damage. Many mobs have an advanced path-finding system that allows them to navigate through obstacles to get to a desired object or destination. [Passive mobs](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Mob#Passive) flee in random directions after being hurt, while [hostile mobs](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Mob#Hostile_mobs) face and chase/attack the [player](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Player) as soon as the [player](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Player) comes close. [Neutral mobs](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Mob#Neutral) remain neutral until a [player](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Player) or mob provokes it (usually by attacking), at which point [neutral mob](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Mob#Neutral) becomes hostile toward and attacks the [entity](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Entity) that hit it. Most [mobs](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Mob) are aware of [players](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Player) within 16 [blocks](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Block) of them, but some can see farther.*

*Most [mobs](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Mob) cannot see through most solid blocks, including semi-transparent blocks such as [ice](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Ice), [glass](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Glass), [tall grass](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Grass), or [glass panes](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Glass_Pane).*[^2]
