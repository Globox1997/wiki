## Story

*The Wither Puppet, born from the dark magic mastery of the Necromancer, is a formidable entity summoned to protect its master. *

## Behavior

Created with a single purpose, the Wither Puppet acts as a loyal defender, unleashing devastating attacks upon any who dare to threaten the Necromancer's abode.

* **Melee:** The Wither Puppet attacks with its hands, dealing 5 damage. There is a 20% chance that its strikes will inflict the wither effect upon its target.
* **Dissipate:** When the Necromancer is defeated, the Wither Puppet vanishes, fading away into nothingness.
