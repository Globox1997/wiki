# Structure

*A [structure](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Structure) is defined as what is disabled when the "Generate structures" world creation option is turned off. Features, such as [monster room](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Monster_Room) and [desert wells](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Desert_Well), do still generate with this option turned off.*[^1]
