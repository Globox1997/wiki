# Datapack
The knowledge for how to create a [datapack](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_pack) in [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) is important if you want to use a datapack system of any kind of mods.  
In the vanilla game, you can with the power of [datapacks](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_pack) already do a lot of stuff.  

Usually I put information of a datapack system in one of my mods on the github readme.

If you are new to [datapacks](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_pack) then check out this [information](https://docs.wispforest.io/datapack-tutorial/) about how to create a [datapack](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_pack) or just watch video about datapacks.

Have fun adjusting the game by creating datapacks!
