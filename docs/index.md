### :octicons-repo-16: About me

My name is Micha aka Globox_Z, I am 25 years old and a mechanical engineer student from Germany. In my free time I like to create fabric Minecraft mods, specifically in the rpg and medieval genre. I love the game plus its possibilities, have fun with it and have a good one!
