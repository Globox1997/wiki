We launched our own server hosting company called ServerAtelier!
We put a lot of love into it and kept it a secret for a long time until today :)

If you want to support us, you could just check out our Website [https://www.serveratelier.com/](https://www.serveratelier.com/).
Would be awesome if you could tell us what you think about it and how you may like it :)

For now we will only offer Minecraft servers but in the future we will expand on that.  
Also with feedback we will enhance our website to better meet the needs of our community.  
Our main moto is: "By Gamers For Gamers" which means, yes we are still Gamers (even tho the 24h design of a day in this world is quite limiting) and provide quality servers for ourselves and others.  
This also means we will only offer servers (and for example mods and modpacks) we would use or are using by ourselves!
