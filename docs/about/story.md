A secret place to tell some story.  

Below this you can see a planet looking kinda similar to the earth. Of course it is not exact but it should be based on the world.

To initiate i have a question to think about for you.  
Is it not crazy that you live on this world called earth?  

Yes you are one of the approximately 8 billion people on a (nearly) round ball hovering around in something called the universe.
This universe is faaaar too big to think about what size it could have but I think it is awesome how much knowledge humanity could already gather about it.
More to come...
