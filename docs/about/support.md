## **Help on Discord**

**Support is available on the public [Globox_Z Discord](https://discord.gg/cV4cJyGXqF)**

- Open an issue on the specific mod repository by filling out the given issue template on the respective repository.
- If you aren't answered right away, **be patient and stay connected**. Discord often is paced more like a forum than a chat room. Even though people are connected, they may actually be away from their computer when you join.
